# Plan 03-01: Add claude-notify skill

## Goal

Add desktop notification support for Claude Code by creating a new skill `setup-claude-notify` that guides users through installation and configuration of claude-notify.

## Context

- **Phase**: 3 of 5 in v1.1 Developer Tools milestone
- **Pattern reference**: Existing skills like `setup-zoxide`, `setup-karabiner`
- **Tool info**: claude-notify provides desktop alerts when Claude Code tasks complete, errors occur, or input is needed

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create skill directory `.claude/skills/setup-claude-notify/`
- [ ] Task 2: Create `SKILL.md` with installation and usage guide
- [ ] Task 3: Update `.claude/skills/onboard/SKILL.md` to add claude-notify to Available Skills table
- [ ] Task 4: Update `config.json` to add `claude_notify` to optional_tools
- [ ] Task 5: Update `CLAUDE.md` Verification Commands section
- [ ] Task 6: Commit changes

## Files to Create/Modify

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `.claude/skills/setup-claude-notify/SKILL.md` | Create | New skill with installation guide |
| `.claude/skills/onboard/SKILL.md` | Modify | Add to Available Skills table |
| `config.json` | Modify | Add `claude_notify: true` to optional_tools |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Modify | Add verification command |

## SKILL.md Content

```markdown
# Claude-Notify Setup

Get desktop notifications when Claude Code finishes tasks, encounters errors, or needs input.

**Time estimate: 1-2 minutes**

---

## Why This Matters

Say: "Claude-notify sends desktop alerts so you can work on other things while Claude runs long tasks. You'll know immediately when:"
- A task completes
- An error occurs
- Claude needs your approval (bash commands)

Ask: "Want to set this up? It's quick and very useful for background work."

---

## Step 1: Install

```bash
brew tap mylee04/tools
brew install claude-notify
```

Ask: "Did it install? Run `cn --help` to check."

---

## Step 2: Enable Globally

```bash
cn on
```

Say: "This enables notifications for all Claude Code sessions."

---

## Step 3: Verify It Works

```bash
cn status
```

Say: "You should see 'Notifications: enabled'. Now start a Claude Code session and you'll get notified when tasks complete."

---

## Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cn on` | Enable notifications globally |
| `cn off` | Disable notifications globally |
| `cnp on` | Enable for current project only |
| `cnp off` | Disable for current project |
| `cn status` | Check current configuration |
| `cnp voice on` | Enable voice alerts (macOS) |

---

## Per-Project Settings

Say: "You can override global settings per project:"

```bash
cnp on      # Enable just for this project
cnp off     # Disable just for this project
```

Say: "Project settings are stored in `.claude/settings.json` in the project root."

---

## Voice Notifications (macOS)

Say: "Want Claude to speak when tasks complete?"

```bash
cnp voice on
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications not appearing?

1. Check it's enabled: `cn status`
2. Ensure system notifications are allowed for Terminal/iTerm/Ghostty
3. Try disabling and re-enabling: `cn off && cn on`

---

## Wrap Up

Say: "That's it! Now you can let Claude work in the background and you'll be notified when it needs you."

Say: "This is especially useful with tmux - start Claude in one pane, work in another, and get notified when it's done."

Ask: "Any questions about claude-notify?"
```

## Verification

- [ ] `.claude/skills/setup-claude-notify/SKILL.md` exists
- [ ] Onboard skill references the new skill
- [ ] `config.json` includes `claude_notify` in optional_tools
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` includes verification command
- [ ] Changes committed
