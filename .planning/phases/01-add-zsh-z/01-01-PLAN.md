# Plan 01-01: Add zsh-z Section to setup-shell SKILL.md

## Goal

Add zsh-z directory jumping plugin documentation to the existing setup-shell skill, following the established patterns.

## Context

- **Phase**: 1 of 1 — Add zsh-z to setup-shell
- **Skill location**: `.claude/skills/setup-shell/SKILL.md`
- **Pattern**: Useful Plugins section (lines 114-129) already exists with git, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting
- **Key insight**: zsh-z (`z` plugin) is built-in to Oh My Zsh — no git clone needed, just add to plugins array

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add zsh-z to Useful Plugins section

**File**: `.claude/skills/setup-shell/SKILL.md`

**What to add** (after line 128, before the `---` separator):

```markdown

### Directory Jumping with zsh-z

Say: "Want to jump between directories faster? The `z` plugin tracks your most-used directories."

Add `z` to your plugins line in `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
plugins=(git z zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

Say: "No installation needed — it's built into Oh My Zsh!"

After `source ~/.zshrc`, use it like this:
- `z foo` - Jump to most frecent directory matching "foo"
- `z bar baz` - Jump to directory matching both "bar" and "baz"

Say: "The more you use it, the smarter it gets. After a few `cd` commands, try `z` with part of a directory name."
```

**Verification**: Read the file and confirm section was added correctly

### Task 2: Update plugins example to include z

**File**: `.claude/skills/setup-shell/SKILL.md`

**What to change**: Update the existing plugins example on line 119 to include `z`:

From:
```bash
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

To:
```bash
plugins=(git z zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

**Why**: Consistency — if we're recommending useful plugins, include z in the main example

### Task 3: Commit changes

**Command**:
```bash
git add .claude/skills/setup-shell/SKILL.md
git commit -m "docs: add zsh-z plugin to setup-shell skill"
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] zsh-z section added to Useful Plugins in SKILL.md
- [ ] Main plugins example includes `z`
- [ ] Changes committed

## Estimated Duration

~5 minutes
